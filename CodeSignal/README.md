As a English and Big Data major, I feel like I still need to "warmn up" before venturing into something as complicated as Leet Code.

Like what the professor said before, this would give me breathing room and ready me for the more challenging aspects of future classes.

In the first few weeks of the class, I used Codesignal due to the fact that I haven't had the slightest idea what the teacher was doing. It was after a few tries that I begin to get the hang of it and began to use LeetCode.
