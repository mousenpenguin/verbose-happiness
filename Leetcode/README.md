# 155. Min Stack
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

-   push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
-   pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
-   top() -- Get the top element.
-   getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks
Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

-   push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
-   pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
-   peek() -- Get the front element.
-   empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

# 27.Remove Element
Given an array  _nums_  and a value  _val_, remove all instances of that value  [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)  and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by  **modifying the input array  [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)**  with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

# 707.Design Linked List
Implement these functions in your linked list class:

-   `get(index)`  : Get the value of the  `index`-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return  `-1`.
-   `addAtHead(val)`  : Add a node of value  `val` before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
-   `addAtTail(val)`  : Append a node of value  `val` to the last element of the linked list.
-   `addAtIndex(index, val)`  : Add a node of value  `val` before the  `index`-th node in the linked list. If  `index` equals to the length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
-   `deleteAtIndex(index)`  : Delete the  `index`-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

# 645. Set Mismatch
The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.
